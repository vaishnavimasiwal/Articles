# Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a platform for developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed anywhere. It allows developers, sys-admins to easily deploy their applications in containers to run on the host operating system i.e. Linux. The first version was released in 2013, and it has since become extremely popular.

- ## Containers
It is important to understand what containers actually does...
Containers allow a developer to pack an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries, dependencies etc. in a single unit and ship it all out as one package. 
By doing so, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.

- ## Features of Docker
1. **Isolate Environment** It provides isolate environment for application to run. Each Container is independent to another container. 
2. **Services** Services is a list of tasks that lets us specify the state of the container inside a cluster.
3. **Easy and Faster Configuration** We can deploy our code in less time and effort.
4. **Security Management** It allows us to save secrets into the swarm itself and then choose to give services access to certain secrets.
